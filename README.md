Logentries Windows Phone Library.

---------------------------------
Currently, the library provides logic for collecting various system stats: device ID, OS Name and version, Memory-related stats (total amount, utilization) and Network interfaces info.
All this logic is located within DeviceMetricsUtils class.

Functions list is the following:
1) GetDeviceName()
2) GetDeviceVendor()
3) GetOSVersion()
4) GetDeviceMemoryAmount()
5) GetAppPeakMemoryUsage()
6) GetAppCurrentMemoryUsage()
7) GetDeviceUniqueID()
8) GetNetworksStatuses()

Network interface information is returned as NetworkStatus class instance, which can be serialized for logging purposes.

Also, now the library provides unique traces for log messages: unique trace string is generated during instantiation of an app, that uses the library, and resides during app's lifetime. 
Each log that is generated by the app, will be prefixed by that trace string.
