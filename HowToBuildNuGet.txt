1. Download NuGet tool from here: http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases/view/121838 ; add the path to this tool to your %PATH%.
2. Change directory to .\LogEntries.WP8 or .\LogEntries.WP7, depending on the version of Windows Phone you want to build the package for.
3. Execute the following command to generate the package specification xml file: nuget spec
4. In the generated nuspec file change <projectUrl>, <releaseNotes> and <copyright> nodes - these values are hard-coded; other ones, like <title> will be extracted from the csproj attributes.
5. Delete <licenseUrl> and <iconUrl> nodes if they are not needed;
6. Execute the following command to build the NuGet package: nuget pack LogEntries.WP8.csproj
   Please, note, that you must have the project been built before packing it with NuGet.
   Please, note, that you must specify a csproj, NOT a nuspec file!
   Please, note, that if state just "nuget pack", NuGet will build the dafault configuration, which is, typically, "Debug". If you need to build a release version, please pass
   "-Prop Configuration=Release" option to NuGet. If you also need to add all projects, that are referenced by the current one, please, state "-IncludeReferencedProjects" option.
7. After the package is built, you may publish the package either via UI on http://www.nuget.org/ , or by using "nuget push" from command-line (in this case, you must provide
the API Key using "nuget setApiKey Your-API-Key" command). Please, refer to https://docs.nuget.org/create/creating-and-publishing-a-package

Troubleshooting.
----------------

1. If you get an error, like this one "The replacement token 'author' has no value.", please, fill all required properties in .csproj file:   
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("LogEntries")]                                                                   -> used to fill $title$ property in nuspec;
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("This library provides support for sending logs to LogEntries' service")]  -> used to fill $description$ in nuspec;
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("LogEntries")]                                                                 -> used to fill $author$ in nuspec; 
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]                                                                    -> used to fill $id$ in nuspec.

2. If you get an error like this one: "Unable to find 'D:\...\LogEntries.WP7\Bin\Release\LogEntries.dll'. Make sure the project has been built.", please, rebuild the project
with REQUIRED configuration (in the example, this is "Release").
